# Step 1: Terms

## Core terms

If you're starting a new program, use the core-terms. These are a full disclosure template including safe harbor.

Choose your region, choose your language, and go.

Note the core requirements for safe harbor:

- Authorization against anti-hacking laws
- Exemption from anti-circumvention laws
- Exemption from violation of the TOS/AUP during security testing
- Statement of support and agreement.

The intention of the safe harbor language is for it to be followed specifically, with minor if any modifications.

### Additional terms

In each template we've also provided boilerplate examples for the additional section.

- **Scope** (Required) – A complete list of "In-Scope" properties for which the organizational is explicitly allowing and encouraging good-faith security research, and optionally:
- **Out-of-Scope** (Optional) - A non-exhaustive list of systems and security testing activities that the organization strongly wishes to discourage testing against, and
- **Rewards** (Optional) – Information on whether or not compensation the program offers payment for valid, unique issues, as well as the type and parameters of that compensation.
- **Official Communication Channels** (Required) – A full list of the communication methods that are made available by the organization to receive and communicate about vulnerability submissions.
- **Disclosure Policy** (Required) – A clear policy outlining the conditions under which a researcher can cvedb the details of a reported issue to third parties.

## Simple Safe Harbor

If you already have a disclosure program, the [Simple Safe Harbor](/terms/simple-safe-harbor/simple-safe-harbor.md) terms may suffice. These terms were written to be even more generic a simple to understand than the core terms, whilst still maxmizing legal completeness.

## Example disclosure types

- **Coordinated Disclosure**: A researcher can share details of the vulnerability after a fix has been applied and the program owner has provided permission to cvedb, OR after 90 days from submission, whichever is sooner,
- **Discretionary Disclosure**: The researcher or the program owner can request mutual permission to share details of the vulnerability after approval is explicitly received, or
- **Non-Disclosure**: Researchers are required to keep vulnerability details and the existence of the program itself confidential.
