> The community-powered index of ALL known public bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs, including their safe harbor status.  

## How to contribute  

If you've found a new program, new information on an existing program, or think a program should be deleted, you can contribute to bug-bounty-list by issuing a pull request (PR) to the repo. If you're new to Github, [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) is a good primer on how PRs work.

## Before you go hunting for new programs to add

Programs on bug-bounty-list need to satisfy the definition of a public bug bounty or vulnerability disclosure program, which means they need two key components:

  1. A publicly accessible vulnerability disclosure policy sometimes called a program brief, or bounty brief, and
  2. A publicly accessible channel for vulnerability submission **which is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability disclosure policy**.  
  
Some examples of suggestions that won't be accepted:

  1. Private programs  
  2. Invitation-only programs  
  3. Programs that you heard about from a friend but aren't listed publicly  
  4. Programs without a public policy or a nominated channel for communication  

## Definition of fields

- **program_name (required):** What is the name of the company or product team responsible for the program?  
- **policy_url (required):** Where can the policy which defines the program be found? (Usually a webpage e.g. /security, a URL on a vulnerability management platform, or in a robots.txt or security.txt file).  
- **submission_url (required):** Where does policy say vulnerability submissions should be sent? (Usually a web form, a URL on a vulnerability management platform, or an email address. Emails can be added as URLs using 'mailto:').  
- **launch_date (optional):** When does the program say it was launched?  
- **bug_bounty (optional):** Does the program commit to rewarding vulnerabilities?  
- **swag (optional):** Does the program commit to sending swag out for vulnerabilities?  
- **hall_of_fame (optional):** Does the program have a listing or Hall of Fame page acknowledging vulnerability reporters?
- **safe_harbor (required):** Does the program support full or partial safe-harbor?

## How to fill out the safe harbor field

The list supports three safe harbor states: Full, Partial, and None. The flow below will help you determine which applies to the policy as you contribute to the list:  

1. Does the policy mention anything about legal protections for good-faith hackers? If it does, go to Step 2. If not, then you should choose **"None"**.
2. Does the policy talk about authorization of testing and/or an exemption from preexisting legal terms? In addition, does the policy clearly define the scope of testing, the compensation for valid findings, the official communication channels, and a disclosure policy? If so, you should choose **"Full"**. If not got to Step 3.
3. Does the policy talk about "not legally pursuing researchers" or use similar language, but does not explicitly grant authorization and/or exemption for security testing? Are any of the key parameters described above ambiguously defined or missing completely? If so, you should choose **"Partial"**.

## Other tips  

- Launch date can be tricky to find on some programs e.g. it's buried in a press release or blog post and not on the program page. If you think you've found a launch date, please include a reference to where you found it in the PR so the maintainers can check.
- Some companies will offer these things on an ad-hoc or case-by-case basis, but this doesn't mean they're committing to do it for everyone. Be careful with the bug_bounty, swag, and hall_of_fame options. As always, read the program page.
